# Cardi Cashless Payment System

**NOTE: This is an unfinished project and not ready for production use**

Cardi is intended to be used as a cashless card payment system for food courts. You can use it with RFID cards or barcode cards onto which you can load money and the card can then be used to make purchases across different vendors. Money that is left over can be returned to the customer.

This project is built as part of a YouTube video series on [Unconventional Coding](https://youtube.com/@unconv).
